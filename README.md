## Why Glu?

Glu was created as a modern alternative to C for use as a "glue" languageâ€”making it easy to connect and interoperate with other languages and systems, especially via LLVM. While C is fast and portable, it lacks safety, modern tooling, and seamless integration with today's language ecosystems. Glu addresses these gaps with:

- **Simplicity**: Clear, concise syntax inspired by modern languages.
- **Performance**: Fast and resource-efficient, suitable for embedded and high-performance applications.
- **Safety**: Robust type system and safe memory management to prevent common errors.
<!-- - **Productivity**: Integrated tools (package manager, formatter, editor support). -->
- **Interoperability**: Native LLVM integration for easy interaction with Rust, Swift, Clang, and more.
- **Reversibility**: Unique ability to regenerate readable source code from optimized LLVM IR, aiding debugging and understanding of compiler optimizations.
